//Step 1 ðŸ§©â€‹
//Use a series of if, else if, and else statements to decipher the first clue.
//If emblemClue1 is "Eagle", the location starts with "Forum".
//If emblemClue1 is "Lion", the location starts with "Colosseum".
//Otherwise, the location starts with "Villa".

//Answer ðŸ”‘â€‹
let locationStart = "";

{
  locationStart = "Forum";
}
else if (emblemClue1 === "Lion")
{
  locationStart = "Colosseum";
}
else
{
  locationStart = "Villa";
}


//Step 2 ðŸ§©â€‹
//Use boolean logic to decipher the second clue.
//If emblemClue2 is "Laurel" AND the first location is "Forum", append " of Augustus" to the location.
//If emblemClue2 is "Grapes" OR the first location is "Villa", append " of Pompey" to the location.

//Answer ðŸ”‘â€‹
if (emblemClue2 === "Laurel" && locationStart === "Forum")
{
  locationStart += " of Augustus";
}
else if (emblemClue2 === "Grapes" || locationStart === "Villa")
{
  locationStart += " of Pompey";
}


//Step 3 ðŸ§©â€‹
//Use the switch statement to decipher the third clue.
//Depending on the value of emblemClue3, append a direction to the location.
//7 is "North"
//3 is "South"
//9 is "East"
//4 is "West"

//Answer ðŸ”‘â€‹

  case 7:

//Question ðŸ¤”
//Why is it important to be careful when using `==` (double equals) instead of `===` (triple equals) in our conditionals?

//Answer ðŸ”‘
// by using `===` it checks both the value and the type, ensuring a stricter equality check. by using `==`, it can lead to unexpected results of coercion.
