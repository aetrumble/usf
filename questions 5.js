//Caesar remembers he forgot to add his best friend "BRUTUS" to the list. Add him to the beginning of the list.

//There's a method to add elements to the beginning of an array.

//Answer ðŸ”‘â€‹
guests.unshift("BRUTUS");


//Question 1 ðŸ¤”â€‹
//How can you verify that "BRUTUS" was added to the beginning of the array?

//There's a method to add elements to the end of an array.

guests.push("AUGUSTUS", "LUCIA");


//Step 3 ðŸ§©
//Caesar is curious. He wants to know if "SPARTACUS" has been invited. Check if he's on the list and find out at which position.

//- Use the right method to find a specific name in the list and its position.

//Answer ðŸ”‘
const spartacusIndex = guests.indexOf("SPARTACUS");


//Question 2 ðŸ¤”
//What would the value of `spartacusIndex` be if "SPARTACUS" wasn't invited?

//Answer ðŸ”‘
//when spartacus isn't invited the indexOf would be -1.


//Step 4 ðŸ§©â€‹
//Oops! Caesar just received a message that "CASSIUS" won't be able to make it. Remove him from the list.

//Find the index of the guest and use the appropriate method to remove him from the list.

//Step 5 ðŸ§©â€‹

//Step 6 ðŸ§©â€‹
