Question 1 ðŸ¤”â€‹
Based on the story of Julius Caesar's secret party and the Caesar Cipher, identify potential variables you would need. Please ensure you use appropriate variable naming conventions in JavaScript.

Answer ðŸ”‘â€‹
shiftValue
encryptedMessage
decryptedMessage

Question 2 ðŸ¤”â€‹
After identifying the variables from the story, specify their primitive data types in JavaScript. Also, provide these variables with some initial values.

Answer ðŸ”‘â€‹
const shiftValue = 3; = number
let encryptedMessage = ""; = string
let decryptedMessage = ""; = string

â€‹
Question 3 ðŸ¤”â€‹
From the variables you've identified, determine which ones should be declared using const and which ones should use let.

Answer ðŸ”‘â€‹
const shiftValue = 3; the shiftvalue will change the letters from one letter to another by shifting it 3 times to change it to somethingelse.
let encryptedMessage = ""; the encrupted message will change a normal sentense to a weird text from.
let decryptedMessage = ""; the decripted message will change the weird text back to a normal sentense.

Question 4 ðŸ¤”
Given the variable `shiftValue`, write a piece of code to check if its value is an integer.

Answer ðŸ”‘
const shiftValue = 3;
Number.isInteger(shiftValue);
The integer will comeback as true.

const shiftValue = 3.14; or const shiftValue = '3';
Number.isInteger(shiftValue);
the integer will comeback as false.
